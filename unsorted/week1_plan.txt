Hi,

Thanks for writing, I hope that you feel better!

You should contact your TAs for information on what you miss in 
recitation:
https://www.math.cmu.edu/~jmackey/151_128/recitations.html

You should read chapter 0 and section 1.1 here:
https://infinitedescent.xyz/dl/infdesc.pdf

Please get notes from a classmate for the classes and recitations that you
miss. Here is an approximate idea of what we will do on Monday through
Friday:


Monday:

Welcome to CMU, Introduction of Course Staff, Logistical course details

PSET 1 is posted on the hw site and on gradescope.


Tell me what's in chapter 0:

N -> base b expansion
Z -> a|b and 
     whenever b is not zero there is a unique q and 0 <= r < |b| s.t. a = bq + r 
Q
R
C

Polynomials and the Quadratic Formula



Solve sqrt(x-3) = x-5
Note that question should say "find all real numbers x such that..."
Variables should be quantified. We need to see the "=>" symbols.


State the Pythagorean Theorem

Introduce Pythagorean Triples, have students give a few


Interlude: |x|^2 = |x^2|

Changing quantification is powerful. 
Most will easily agree that for all real x, |x|^2 = |x^2|.
Changing to quantify over C, we can ask if this is still true. 
It is, but it is less obvious.
We are really asking whether f(g(x))=g(f(x)) for two functions.

Do the computation |(a+bi)^2| = |a+bi|^2 and then note how as a bonus we have a 
pythagorean triple generating machine! It yields all *primitive* triples, but not
all triples, for example (9,12,15).


Berggren (1934) All primitive with b even can be gotten by starting with (3,4,5) and 
applying

1 -2 2   -1 2 2   1 2 2
2 -1 2   -2 1 2   2 1 2
2 -2 3   -2 2 3   2 2 3


Get students to play the finger game and display expected winnings for odd player to
get the 7/12 one-finger strategy.

odd plays 1 p percent and even plays 1 q percent
exp odd winnings = -4 + q (7-12p) + 7p


Wednesday:

No Canvas, see site for syllabus, HW, etc. HW submission will be through
gradescope.

https://www.overleaf.com/learn

HW1 and LaTex source posted, due next Wednesday.

Please read 1.2 and 1.3 for Friday.

Recall that variables should be quantified, and implications put in
explicitly.

A propositional variable is a variable that assumes the values true and
false.
Logical connectives, not, and, or, if, iff and conditions for truth.

Deduce that (-1)(-1)=1 from other (field) axioms. See page 532 of Clive.
Perhaps leave as a problem to show that 0*x = 0 for all real numbers x.

Prove that sqrt(2) is irrational, introducing proof by contradiction:
p is logically equivalent with -p => (q and -q) or some other
contradiction
If we are proving p=>q by contradiction, then negating it yields p and -q
to start and work toward a contradiction.

Base b notation, algorithms to find it (right to left and left to right).
Note that we will prove that these algorithms are correct later in the
course.

Friday:

Please read 2.1.

Recall propositional variables and connectives. Today we introduce
quantifiers!

A Propositional Formula is an expression that is either a propositional
variable, or is "built up" from simpler propositional formulae using a
logical operator.

Predicate - symbol p with variables x1,...,xn coming from sets. Evaluates
to True or False when xi are all known.

Introduce "for every" and "there exists"

Logical Formula - predicate with some (possibly all) of the variables
bound by quantifiers. Free variable sets
                    should be displayed for the reader.

Logically equivalent and tautology with simple examples p or (not p), etc.

Perhaps a note about the importance of parenthesization p => (q ^ p) vs
(p=>q) ^ p.

Demorgan's Laws, Contrapositive, not(p implies q)<=> p and (not q),
(p<=>q) <=> (p=>q) and (q=>p), p or q <=> (not p) implies q.


EX - (for every x in R) (there is y in R) [(y<x) and (|x-y|=1)]
The above is true, and students prove it.

EX - (there is y in R) (for every x in R) [(y<x) and (|x-y|=1)]
The above is false, so existential and universal quantifiers don't
commute.
We need to negate and prove the above statement.


Discuss negation of statements
-[(for all x in A) P(x)]  is equivalent with (there is x in A) -P(x)
and
-[(there is x in A) P(x)] is equivalent with (for all x in A) -P(x).

Students prove the negation of the earlier statement.

Students prove: for every n in Z, (n prime => (n is odd) or (n=2))
It's easist by contrapositive

Best, JM
