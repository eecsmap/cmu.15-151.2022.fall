Hi,

Thanks for writing, I hope that you feel better!
We don't record the lectures and recitations.

You should contact your TAs for information on what you miss in 
recitation:
https://www.math.cmu.edu/~jmackey/151_128/recitations.html

Please get notes from a classmate for the classes and recitations that you
miss. Here is an approximate idea of what we will do on Wednesday and
Friday:


Wednesday:

Students should read 2.1 for Friday and 2.2 for Monday
PSET 1 is due on Wednesday at 11pm, PSET 2 is posted
SI information: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/supp-inst.html
Drop-In Tutoring is also now available:

Recall: Propositional and Logical Formulae
Recall: Quantification matters, order and parenthesization matter, how to negate quantified statements.


quantification example: (sqrt(x^2)) = x is meaningless by itself, we should talk about what it means 
when x is quantified over positive reals, reals, and complex numbers.


(usually omit) Students negate the definition of f is a continuous function from R to R.


Discussion of why (there is y in B) (for every x in A) P(x,y)
implies (for every x in A) (there is y in B) P(x,y) is true.
(this is known as quantifier alternation)


Let f:R -> R
Consider the following statement: (There is M in R)(For every x in R)(|f(x)| <= M)
What does this express? (f is bounded)


What do you notice about (For every x in R)(There is M in R)(|f(x)| <= M)?
Students come to the conclusion that it is always true, hence the first version
implies the second version (as it should by quantifier alternation).


Have students give an example of a an unbounded function f(x) and have
them prove this by negating the definition of bounded.

Note f(x) = x^2, people usually take x=M+1, which leads to M^2 + 2M + 1 > M,
which is fine since (1/2)[(M+1)^2 + M^2 + 1] is positive.
For f(x) = x, people *can* take x=M+1, but then we need to show |M+1| > M
which is trivially true for M negative, and fine when M is positive.


Students prove: for every n in Z,
(4|n => there exist x,y in Z s.t. n = x^2 - y^2)

Friday:

Students should read 2.2 for next time.
Please don't leave answers written on whiteboards, or in public spaces

Sets Education!

A set is a collection of distinct objects.
The objects are called elements or members.

x \in A, x \notin A, A \subseteq B, A \superseteq B, proper subset
Perhaps mention the difference between "not a subset of" and "subsetneq"

Discussion of "element of" vs "subset of"


Recall: N, Q, Z, and R

U is the universe of discourse

[n] = the set of positive integers not exceeding n.

The empty set. It is unique. You can join the empty set on facebook.
Everything is true about the members of the empty set.

Set Builder Notation:
Ex - A = {2, 4, *}, B = {2k : k \in Z}, C = {n \in Z : \exists k \in Z n =2k+1}

Power set of S, P(S). Calculation of P({a,b}) and P(P(\emptyset)).

SxT and calculation of [2]x[3]

students sketch [0,1]x[-1,2)

A union B = {x \in U : x \in A or x\in B}
A intersect B = {x \in U: x \in A and x \in B}
A \setminus B = {x \in U: x \in A and x \notin B}
A^c = U \setminus A
A and B are disjoint if their intersection is empty


Showing that sets A and B are equal:
1) Show A \subseteq B and B \subseteq A
2) Show (\forall x \in U)(x \in A if and only if x \in B)


Students show that
{(x,y): x,y \in Z and x^2 - y^2 = 1} = {(1,0), (-1,0)}


If time remains, students can show (A-B)u(B-A) = (AuB)-(BnA)


Best, JM
